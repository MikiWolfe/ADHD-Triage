<h2> What household tasks can we accomplish today?</h2>

<h4> We have complied a list of pre-made household chores that you can choose from at random. 
  You will also get a time limit to help keep you on track. 
  Click the button to get your first task! If you don't like it, you can try again! If
  you'd rather make your own list of random chores to be suggested to you, click the custom link and 
  you will be given a box that will let you add in as many tasks 
  as you want and you'll be returned one at random and with 
  a time suggestion as well!  </h4>
